# California Housing Price Prediction

Welcome to the **California Housing Price Prediction** project! This repository contains a Python implementation of a supervised learning model using Linear Regression to predict housing prices based on the California Housing dataset from scikit-learn.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, including:
- Data loading and preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing (normalization and outlier handling)
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Model evaluation with metrics like MSE, MAE, R², and Adjusted R²
- Model persistence using Pickle

The dataset used is the California Housing dataset, which includes features like average rooms, bedrooms, latitude, longitude, and more, with the target variable being the house price.

## Repository Structure

- `housing_prediction.py`: The main Python script containing the code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `model.pkl`: The trained Linear Regression model saved as a Pickle file.
- `boxplot.jpg`: (Optional) Generated boxplot image from EDA (uncomment the plotting code to generate).

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `pickle`

Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aakashverma18/california-housing-prediction.git
   cd california-housing-prediction
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the Python script to train the model and generate predictions:
   ```bash
   python housing_prediction.py
   ```

3. **Load and Use the Saved Model**:
   After running the script, a `model.pkl` file will be created. You can load and use it for predictions as follows:
   ```python
   import pickle
   model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))
   # Example prediction (replace with your normalized test data)
   predictions = model.predict(x_test_norm)
   print(predictions)
   ```

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizes features using `StandardScaler` to handle outliers and scale the data.
- **EDA**: Includes correlation analysis and (optionally) visualizations like pair plots and boxplots.
- **Model**: Uses Linear Regression from scikit-learn with coefficients and intercept printed for interpretability.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R² Score
  - Adjusted R² Score
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Results

The model provides insights into feature importance via regression coefficients and evaluates performance with standard regression metrics. Residuals are visualized to assess model fit.
